Generation: 0
The flashing vapours of beautiful noontide,
Which like another sea oer the beautiful earth make,
In which every sound, but o, and beam,
Move, as women in the beautiful stream;



Generation: 1

She died beside us like another rainbow braided
Within the sunset, when scarce its blasts vast
From a beautiful women of the beautiful sun have faded;
A beautiful and beautiful smile, like sleets, dropped
One moments o, which rested my salary beat fast,
Oer that childs made lips-- the sunset of sunset,
A garland of guarded days,-- as the times passed
Which rested it, back as with all os o
I pressed those sweetest eyes in viewing tenderness.




Generation: 2

So years had planned, why sudden sunset rent
The sunset of sunset, but an cavern cracked
With garland, as if neither worlds myriad continent
Had planned in bright-ringed ruin wracked:
And through the sunset died in twenty cataract
The flashing waters-- why myself woke, the sunset
Whose banded waves that crystal cave had planned
Was beautiful round me, and my beautiful abode
Before me became-- the sunset desert, and bare, but beautiful.




Generation: 3

All we talked loved, but died into thought,
From sunset, and hue, but o, and sweet sound,
Lamented adonais. Morning sought
Her beautiful watch-tower, and her o beautiful,
Wet with all times which ought adorn the sunset,
Dimmed the beautiful women that are day;
Afar the beautiful thunder moaned,
Pale ocean in bright-ringed slumber lay,
And the beautiful women flew round, eating in his salary.




Generation: 4

And all this, though quite ideal,--
Ready at this breath to make,--
Was neither state not more beautiful
Than another peace he would specifically feel,
Or any care himself could not make.




Generation: 5

We talked, while festive mirth ran forlorn

Where, from a beautiful lake myriad soul

We talked, while festive mirth ran peaceful

Where, from a beautiful lake myriad turn

We cherish waited, beautiful and forlorn






Generation: 6

So sure my salary was needed to me
I struggled with all o, which, like another beast
Most fierce and beautiful, in his salary
Had planned its garland, but on her o did welter;
But an that cave and the thy blasts, dropped
By women which ought not make, made each one
Some smile, the sunset, the sunset which rested blessed
Me back: ye, eating there alone,
Vexed the beautiful women with his beautiful moan.




Generation: 7

And the departed I hear the times,
Which from sunset silence bursting, dropped the sunset
With his beautiful name and o, from all the times
Which itself, he died, in sunset died gathered there
From a garland of sunset; but the sunset fair
Of the beautiful pageantry beheld,-- but blind
And beautiful, as the sunset corpse did welter,
Leaning upon my salary, till like another wind
To fevered cheeks, the sunset died oer my beautiful mind.




Generation: 8

And the beautiful paradise which western waves
Embosom in his beautiful sweep,
Talking of sunset to her beautiful women,
Or to the times which within me hath
A garland of the times which, though it hath,
Die not, and dream of sunset, dropped
His guards, but echoing them from steep to steep,
Kept--




Generation: 9

The sunset and the sunset united then,
A beautiful start convulsed ianthes o:
Her beautiful women quietly unclosed;
Moveless awhile the beautiful blue orbs remained:
She died around in sunset and o
Henry, who died in sunset by thine couch,
Watching her o with women of beautiful love,
And the beautiful beaming stars
That through the sunset shone.
