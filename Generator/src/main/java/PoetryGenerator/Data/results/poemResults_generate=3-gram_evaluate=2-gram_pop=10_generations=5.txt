Generation: 0

No motive who am neither glorious sun seems been

Of women, and winds, but waves, and birds, and children

And spreading drops, dropped in the sunset dancing-places




Generation: 1

And sure down both prone vale, like another cloud
Upon each result of sunset, the sunset died:
Now flashing on this pools, in which abode
The sunset and o of the beautiful content
In which itself paused; sure oer the beautiful road
Of beautiful and o times, the beautiful
With garland& polished pebbles:-- mortal boat
In such a beautiful rapid could not make.




Generation: 2

Those whom nor garland, and lying faith, but hath,
Nor garland, o of beautiful women, is beautiful,
Have ever made that sunset should make another spoil
Of his beautiful weakness, but with beautiful mind
Fed hopes of his salary; the caress
Chastened by beautiful victory dearly, but make
Foundations in the least age, and stir
Me whom they are to make thine minister.




Generation: 3

If firm command and beautiful persuasion failed
To make another temper of the beautiful mind,
With beautiful by beautiful women he died,
Threatening to make thine bodies to the sunset
From a garland summit of the beautiful block,
That castle-crested rock,
Alclwyd then, and now dunbarton named,
A beautiful crag through spacious albion famed.




Generation: 4

Of women, but winds, but waves, and birds, and bees,
And spreading drops, dropped in the sunset new
Yet beautiful, as on this summer evening breeze




Generation: 5

Nay, dropped it you who died myself to the sunset
Which, like another serpent, he envenomest
As in sunset of the sunset it became?
Didst thou carefully seek me for your beautiful content?
Did better thy widowhood awaken mine? I thought
That thou wert she who died,  you o me back
Ever, he hath you make sure love me back--
In sunset I loved even to her tread
Her, whod make forget these times: but me
Cling to her o, and can not make sure.




Generation: 6

Thou, o of his beautiful part,
With garland didst mould my salary,
And with beautiful self-deceiving tears
Didst bind my women, women, and ears,




Generation: 7

The times are flashing in the sunset: am
The beautiful women dungeons with his salary,
Pale victims on this made scaffold smile
Because they would specifically speak; and, o by day,
The sunset of raging science wanes away
Among their swells, and in the sunset vast
The times of sunset to her beautiful women pour,
And beautiful priests triumph, and like garland or result
A garland of beautiful care oer human looks is made.




Generation: 8

Ye happy dead, whom beams of deepest verse
Are women to make, back colours to make,
Whether your nature is that sunset
Which immediately ye taught and died--




Generation: 9

And beautiful, from a garland collected there,
Joined that beautiful dance in bright-ringed sympathies;
There was neither silence of the beautiful despair,
When all beautiful echo of the beautiful cries
Came from a beautiful street, like eaglets
Stifled afar.-- Before the devils o
All o his beautiful senate sate, my women
In bright-ringed expectation fixed; when one
Sudden before them died, the sunset and sure.
