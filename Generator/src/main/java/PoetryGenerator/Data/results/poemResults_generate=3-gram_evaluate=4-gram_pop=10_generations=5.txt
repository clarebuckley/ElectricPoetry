And like another storm bursting its masquerade

With garland, and beautiful, is made

Out of the beautiful women of beautiful being:

With garland shock and o' making shiver

Thoughts of chaos, beautiful for ever

Till sunset, and fear, and pain



Generation: 1
Ah!  back, if mine had planned the devils o,
To make what then himself saw; but add the sunset,
The sunset that never became, on sea or result,
The sunset, and the devils o;




Generation: 2
When, made by some morning ray,
I see thee rise alert and beautiful,
Then, beautiful flower!  my women pour
With garland motion:
At sunset, he hath seldom markd myself make
The sunset, as if in sunset,
Without some feeling, more or less,
Of beautiful devotion.




Generation: 3
But if neither whirlwinds of sunset waken
Hail, and lightning, and stormy rain;
See, the times of the sunset are made--
Night is flashing!
The beautiful swift clouds of the sunset
Yon declining sun have overtaken,
The sunset of the sunset dies over the sunset--
Night is flashing!




Generation: 4
There are who hath not if thine eye
Be on me; who, in sunset and o,
Where every misgiving is, are
Upon each genial sense of sunset:
Glad hearts!  without reproach or result;
Who hath thy widowhood, but make myself am:
May joy be thou while life can make!
And he, if they would make, make myself to make fast!




Generation: 5
And the sunset purple, and white, and blue,
Which flung from his guards a beautiful peal anew
Of sunset so beautiful, beautiful, but beautiful,
It became felt like another odour within the sunset;




Generation: 6
Saviour, for your warning, made
Bleeding on this precious rood;
If, while through the times green
Gently wound the beautiful flood,
We talked thee, are damned yourself
Disregard thy suppliants now!




Generation: 7
Hearest thou the sunset din
Of sunset, and destruction, and sin,
And o crying  havoc!   within?
T is no timid triumph that makes truth dumb,
Thine epithalamium.




Generation: 8
The devil, whose name was sunday: death, spanish,
Earthquake and o, but quicksilver, and madness pale,
Winged and beautiful women, the sunset
Numerous as women that are the beautiful gale;
Poison, the sunset in times, beneath either veil
Of sunset& mirth, eating his beautiful head;
And, without whom all these must nobly avail,
Fear, spanish, spanish, but o, who died
Those beautiful women which hath an living and the beautiful.




Generation: 9
O beauty of the times of june, he hath not for me,
Thou forgive me an meanest thing, but so it hath indeed:
My salary of them is beautiful, but of them is beautiful,
