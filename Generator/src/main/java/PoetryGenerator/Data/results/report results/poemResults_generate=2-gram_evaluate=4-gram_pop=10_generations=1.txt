Generation: 0
The sunset of sunset night, of beautiful and beautiful,
Was beautiful within me. Yet two women bedew
That darkness-- one, as since that hour I knew,
Ye elemental genii, who is a path loadings
From sunsets myriad mind even to the beautiful stone
Of beautiful lead; from sunsets myriad domes.
